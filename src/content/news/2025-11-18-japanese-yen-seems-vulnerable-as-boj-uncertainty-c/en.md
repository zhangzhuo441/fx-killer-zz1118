The Japanese Yen (JPY) showed some signs of recovery during the Asian session on Tuesday, bouncing slightly from its lowest exchange rate against the US Dollar (USD) since early February. Despite this minor uptick, the currency remains vulnerable as uncertainty regarding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy continues to overshadow any potential for a significant appreciation.

Traders are cautious as the BoJ's stance on intervention remains unclear, creating a challenging environment for the JPY. The latest trading activity indicates that any attempts to rally could be limited, with the USD/JPY currency pair still trading at elevated levels. Market participants will be closely watching developments from the BoJ, as shifts in policy could have substantial implications for the exchange rate moving forward.
