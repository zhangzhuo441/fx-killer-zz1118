AUD/USD is trading around 0.6510 on Monday, showing a decline of 0.40% for the day. The Australian Dollar has weakened against the US Dollar as traders reassess their outlook on Federal Reserve policy and the likelihood of upcoming rate cuts. This shift in sentiment has led to a pullback from the gains made in the previous week.

As market participants react to stronger USD fundamentals, expectations for Fed rate cuts have diminished, further impacting the AUD/USD exchange rate. The current market dynamics suggest a cautious approach among investors, with the currency pair facing potential pressures as the focus shifts to economic indicators and Fed commentary in the coming days.
