The EUR/USD currency pair ended Friday with a slight decrease of 0.10%, closing just above the critical 1.1600 level. Despite this weekly dip, the pair managed to secure an overall gain of 0.51% as market sentiment shifted amid rising expectations that the Federal Reserve may pause its easing cycle in the upcoming month. 

The shift in trading dynamics reflects diminishing risk appetite, influencing the exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar. The ability of EUR/USD to maintain its position above the 1.1600 threshold suggests potential for further upside, as traders assess the implications of Fed policy on future currency movements.
