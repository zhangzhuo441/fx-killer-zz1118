Japan's Cabinet Office is set to release its preliminary Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the third quarter (Q3) at 23:50 GMT. Analysts expect a contraction of 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, a stark contrast to the previous growth of 0.5%. This shift could significantly influence the USD/JPY currency pair as traders react to the implications of a weakening Japanese economy on the exchange rate.

A disappointing GDP reading may lead to a bearish sentiment in the Yen, potentially pushing the USD/JPY higher as traders seek safer assets. Market participants will closely monitor the data, as a worse-than-expected outcome could prompt speculation about further monetary easing from the Bank of Japan. The response in the forex market could create volatility in trading, impacting not just the USD/JPY but also other cross-currency pairs involving the Yen.
