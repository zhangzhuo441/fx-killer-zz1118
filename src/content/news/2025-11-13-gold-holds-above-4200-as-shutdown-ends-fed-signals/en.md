Gold (XAU/USD) continues its upward momentum, surpassing the $4,200 mark on Thursday and marking a five-day winning streak. This rally comes as market sentiment shifts following the resolution of the recent government shutdown, coupled with the Federal Reserve's signals that temper expectations for aggressive easing measures. 

As gold retraces much of its corrective decline from its all-time high of approximately $4,381, traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate's resilience. The precious metal's performance is drawing attention as uncertainties in the broader economy persist, making it a favored asset for investors seeking refuge amidst fluctuating currencies like the USD and EUR.
