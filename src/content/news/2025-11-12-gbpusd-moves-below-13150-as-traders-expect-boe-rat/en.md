GBP/USD has declined for the second consecutive day, now trading around 1.3140 during the Asian session on Wednesday. The currency pair's depreciation is attributed to increasing market speculation surrounding a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) in December, which is weighing heavily on the Pound Sterling.

With the exchange rate slipping below the critical level of 1.3150, traders are closely monitoring any developments that may confirm or dispel these expectations. As sentiment shifts, the continued pressure on the GBP could lead to further declines against the USD, impacting overall market dynamics and influencing trading strategies in the coming weeks.
