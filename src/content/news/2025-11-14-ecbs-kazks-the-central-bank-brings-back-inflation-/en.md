During the European trading session on Friday, Mārtiņš Kazāks, a policymaker for the European Central Bank (ECB) and Governor of the Central Bank of Latvia, reaffirmed the ECB's commitment to bringing inflation back to its 2% target. His comments suggest that the current interest rates will remain unchanged, which could influence the EUR/USD exchange rate stability as traders digest the implications for European monetary policy.

The EUR has remained resilient against the USD, trading around key technical levels following Kazāks' remarks. With inflationary pressures still a concern, traders will be closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators that could signal the ECB's next moves. This stance may lead to a more cautious approach in the forex market, affecting currency pair dynamics as investors weigh the outlook for both the Euro and the Dollar in the coming weeks.
