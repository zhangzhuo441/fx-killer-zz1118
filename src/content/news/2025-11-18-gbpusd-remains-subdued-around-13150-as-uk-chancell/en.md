GBP/USD remains under pressure, trading around 1.3150 for the third consecutive session during Tuesday’s Asian hours. The exchange rate reflects ongoing weakness in the Pound Sterling (GBP) as uncertainty looms following UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ decision to abandon proposed income tax increases. This move has sparked concerns about the UK’s fiscal policy and its potential impact on economic growth.

As the currency pair struggles to gain traction, market participants are closely monitoring the implications of this policy shift on the UK's economic landscape. The persistence of GBP weakness against the US Dollar (USD) highlights investor caution, with many awaiting further clarity on fiscal measures. The current trading range suggests limited volatility, with GBP/USD caught in a tight pattern as traders assess the broader market sentiment.
