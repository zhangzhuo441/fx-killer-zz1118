Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged to approximately $4,140 during the early Asian session on Wednesday, reflecting a strong upside trend. This rally is fueled by growing expectations of a potential rate cut by the US Federal Reserve by the end of the year, following the recent ADP report indicating job losses in the US. Traders are closely monitoring upcoming comments from Fed officials for further insights.

The bullish movement in gold highlights a shift in market sentiment towards safe-haven assets as concerns about the US economy rise. With the increased demand for gold translating into a higher exchange rate against the USD, market participants are positioning themselves for potential volatility in the forex market, particularly in the USD and EUR currency pairs.
