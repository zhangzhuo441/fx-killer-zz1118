The Japanese Yen (JPY) is facing renewed selling pressure, retreating toward its lowest exchange rate against the US Dollar (USD) since February 13. This comes amid a cautious outlook from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) regarding potential interest rate hikes, which has dampened trader sentiment. As the currency pair fluctuates, market participants remain wary of further downside risks.

The Yen's recent directionless trading underscores a risk-on impulse in global markets, with investors favoring higher-yielding assets. As the USD continues to gain momentum, the JPY's vulnerability is evident, raising concerns about its long-term stability. Traders will be closely monitoring developments from the BoJ for signs of a shift in monetary policy that could impact the JPY's performance in the coming sessions.
