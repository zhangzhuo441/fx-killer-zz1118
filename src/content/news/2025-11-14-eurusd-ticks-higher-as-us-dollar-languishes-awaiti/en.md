EUR/USD continues its upward trajectory, marking its eighth consecutive day of gains on Friday. The currency pair is currently trading at 1.1640, positioning itself for a notable 0.6% rally this week. This sustained momentum reflects a weakening US Dollar as traders await delayed economic data that could influence market sentiment.

The exchange rate's ascent is indicative of investor confidence in the Euro, bolstered by the current market conditions favoring the EUR. As the USD lingers in a state of uncertainty, the implications of this shift may signal further opportunities for traders looking to capitalize on the prevailing trends in the forex market.
