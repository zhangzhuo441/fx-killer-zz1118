The USD/CAD currency pair is gaining momentum, trading around 1.4035 during the early European session on Tuesday. This uptick is fueled by positive developments regarding a potential resolution to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which has now become the longest in history. As investors anticipate an agreement, the U.S. Dollar (USD) strengthens against the Canadian Dollar (CAD).

The improved sentiment around the U.S. fiscal situation has led to increased demand for the USD, pushing the exchange rate higher. Market participants are closely monitoring the negotiations, as a successful resolution could further bolster the dollar's position in the forex market. As the trading session progresses, the USD/CAD pair may continue to react to any new developments concerning the shutdown deal.
