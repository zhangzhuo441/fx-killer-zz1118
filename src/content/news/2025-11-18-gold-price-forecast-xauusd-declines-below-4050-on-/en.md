Gold prices (XAU/USD) have continued to decline, dropping to approximately $4,030 during the early Asian session on Tuesday. This downturn is largely attributed to the strengthening of the USD and the recent hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve, which have led traders to reassess their expectations for a potential interest rate cut in the coming month.

As market sentiment shifts, the exchange rate dynamics between gold and the USD reflect a cautious outlook among investors. The anticipation of stable interest rates may keep pressure on XAU/USD, with traders closely monitoring any further developments from the Fed that could influence future trading strategies.
