Gold (XAU/USD) surged to over a three-week high on Thursday, climbing to approximately $4,213, as traders reacted to dovish sentiment from the Federal Reserve. This rise came despite optimism surrounding the reopening of the U.S. government, which typically supports the USD. The current exchange rate reflects a growing preference for safe-haven assets amid uncertainty in the broader market.

Market participants are adjusting their positions as bets on a softer monetary policy by the Fed weigh on the USD. This shift highlights a complex interplay between fiscal developments and monetary policy expectations, driving demand for gold as a hedge against potential economic instability. As trading continues, investors will closely monitor Fed communications and economic indicators for further clues on future currency pair movements.
