The Japanese Yen (JPY) has rebounded from a nine-month low against the US Dollar (USD), recovering intraday during Tuesday's Asian session. The JPY reached its lowest exchange rate since early February, prompting concerns over potential market intervention. Despite this uptick, the lack of strong buying momentum indicates limited bullish sentiment among traders.

As the currency pair fluctuates, traders remain cautious, weighing the implications of ongoing market dynamics. The Yen's struggle against the USD highlights the broader challenges in the forex market, particularly as economic indicators influence investor confidence. The recovery may provide temporary relief, but without sustained buying activity, the JPY could face further pressure in the coming sessions.
