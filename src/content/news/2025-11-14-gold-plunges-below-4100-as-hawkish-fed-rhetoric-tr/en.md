Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a sharp decline, dropping nearly 2% on Friday as it fell to a daily low of $4,032. The price plunge was driven by increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve may pause its current easing cycle, following a series of hawkish statements from Fed officials that tempered expectations for a December rate cut.

As traders adjusted their positions in response to the Fed's stance, the yellow metal began to recover from its lows, signaling volatility in the market. The shift in sentiment has implications for currency pairs, particularly as the USD strengthens against its counterparts like the EUR, influencing overall trading dynamics in the forex market.
