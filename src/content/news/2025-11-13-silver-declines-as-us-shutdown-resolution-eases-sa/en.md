Silver (XAG/USD) experienced a downturn on Thursday, breaking a four-day winning streak. The grey metal is currently trading around $53.00, reflecting a decline of 0.35% for the day. Earlier, it reached an intraday high of $54.39, approaching its all-time peak of $54.86. This shift in market momentum comes as the resolution of the U.S. government shutdown has led to a decrease in safe-haven demand.

As traders reassess their positions, the easing of uncertainty surrounding U.S. fiscal policy has prompted a decline in silver's appeal as a protective asset. The currency pair's fluctuations indicate a broader market response, influenced by geopolitical factors and economic sentiment. The recent movement may signal a temporary pause in silver's price rally, as investors shift focus from safety to riskier assets amid improving economic conditions.
