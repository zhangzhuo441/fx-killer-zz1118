The Japanese Yen (JPY) faced continued pressure during the Asian trading session on Friday, trading within a narrow range against the US Dollar (USD). The USD/JPY exchange rate hovered just below a nine-month high, reflecting ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy. The Yen's struggles are evident as it remains close to its recent low, with traders closely monitoring developments for potential shifts in the market.

This stagnation highlights the broader implications of BoJ's policies amid rising global interest rates. As the USD retains its strength, the JPY's vulnerability suggests a cautious sentiment among investors. Market participants are weighing their strategies as the currency pair remains sensitive to any changes in the BoJ's stance, which could further influence trading dynamics in the forex market.
