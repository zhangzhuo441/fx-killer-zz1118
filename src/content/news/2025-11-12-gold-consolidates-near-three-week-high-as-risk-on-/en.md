Gold (XAU/USD) remains steady near a three-week high during the Asian trading session on Wednesday, as the risk-on sentiment among investors outweighs expectations of a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. Market participants are closely watching the $4,150-4,155 horizontal resistance level, contemplating a bullish breakout that could signal further gains.

The current price action reflects a delicate balance in the forex market, with gold's resilience highlighting a shift in investor sentiment amid fluctuating exchange rates. As the USD faces pressure, traders in the XAU/USD pair are positioning themselves cautiously for potential upward momentum, while also monitoring developments in broader economic indicators that might impact future trading strategies.
