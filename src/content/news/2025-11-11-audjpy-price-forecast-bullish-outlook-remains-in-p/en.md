The AUD/JPY currency pair saw a decline to approximately 100.60 during the early European session on Tuesday, reflecting a stronger Japanese Yen against the Australian Dollar. This movement comes amid growing concerns surrounding potential verbal intervention from Japanese authorities, which has heightened market volatility.

Despite the current dip, the outlook for AUD/JPY remains bullish, particularly as traders focus on the key level of 100.50. Should intervention fears persist, the exchange rate may experience further fluctuations, impacting trading strategies. Market participants are closely monitoring developments as they navigate the implications of central bank actions on the currency pair's performance.
