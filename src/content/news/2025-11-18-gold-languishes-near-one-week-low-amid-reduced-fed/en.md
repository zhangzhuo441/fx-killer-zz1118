Gold (XAU/USD) continues to face selling pressure, marking its fourth consecutive day of decline as trading volumes remain subdued. The precious metal has drifted closer to its one-and-a-half-week low, recently hovering around the $4,000 mark. This decline is largely attributed to diminished expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, which has influenced market sentiment and reduced demand for gold as a safe-haven asset.

As gold struggles near this critical technical level, traders are closely monitoring the interplay between USD strength and overall market trends. The current exchange rate dynamics suggest that unless there are significant shifts in economic forecasts or monetary policy outlooks, gold may continue to experience volatility. Investors are advised to stay alert to any changes that could impact the currency pair, particularly in relation to the USD and broader market movements.
