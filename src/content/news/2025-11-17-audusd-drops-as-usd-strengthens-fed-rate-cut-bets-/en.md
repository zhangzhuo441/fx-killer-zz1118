AUD/USD is trading at approximately 0.6510 on Monday, reflecting a 0.40% decline for the day. This drop in the Australian Dollar against the US Dollar comes as investors recalibrate their expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. The recent strengthening of the USD has overshadowed the gains the AUD secured last week.

The shift in sentiment is largely attributed to diminishing bets on potential rate cuts from the Fed, which has bolstered the USD's appeal. As traders navigate these changing dynamics, the exchange rate of the AUD/USD remains under pressure, indicating that the market is closely monitoring developments in US economic data and Fed communications for further direction.
