ICE Brent crude oil prices rose nearly 1.2% last week, buoyed by a Friday rally that followed a Ukrainian attack on the Russian port of Novorossiysk. This development has the potential to disrupt oil shipments from the strategic port, impacting global supply dynamics and contributing to increased volatility in energy markets.

The rise in oil prices is likely to influence currency pairs like USD/EUR, as fluctuations in exchange rates may reflect heightened trading activity driven by geopolitical tensions. Traders will be closely monitoring the situation for further developments, which could affect oil-related currencies and overall market sentiment.
