The Australian Dollar (AUD) has edged lower against the US Dollar (USD), with the AUD/USD pair trading in a cautious range following the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) Minutes from its November monetary policy meeting. The exchange rate remains subdued, reflecting ongoing market concerns despite the RBA's signals of a careful approach to future monetary policy decisions.

Traders are closely monitoring the implications of the RBA's cautious stance, which may indicate a reluctance to adjust interest rates aggressively in the near term. As a result, the AUD continues to face pressure in the forex market, struggling to regain momentum against the strengthening USD. The overall sentiment suggests that the currency pair may remain vulnerable to further fluctuations, influenced by upcoming economic data and global market dynamics.
