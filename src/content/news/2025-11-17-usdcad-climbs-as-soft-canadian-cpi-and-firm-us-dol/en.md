The Canadian Dollar (CAD) is under pressure against the US Dollar (USD) as USD/CAD climbs following the release of Canada’s October inflation report. Currently trading at approximately 1.4040, the Loonie is facing headwinds from a combination of a soft consumer price index and a robust Greenback. These factors are contributing to a bearish sentiment surrounding the CAD in the forex market.

As the exchange rate moves higher, traders are closely monitoring developments that could further impact the currency pair. The firm performance of the USD continues to elevate the pressure on the CAD, which raises concerns about potential long-term implications for the Canadian economy. With the market reacting to economic data, volatility in USD/CAD is expected to persist in the coming sessions.
