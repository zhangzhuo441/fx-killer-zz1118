The USD/CAD currency pair is currently experiencing a pullback after hitting resistance at 1.4150. Analysts at Société Générale highlight that the pair is now trending toward critical technical levels, specifically the 200-day moving average and channel support situated between 1.3930 and 1.3880. 

Market participants are closely watching this support zone, as a potential bounce could provide a buying opportunity. However, a decisive break below these levels could signal further declines in the exchange rate, prompting traders to reassess their positions in the wake of this downward movement. The ongoing fluctuations reflect the broader dynamics influencing the USD and CAD as traders navigate prevailing economic conditions.
