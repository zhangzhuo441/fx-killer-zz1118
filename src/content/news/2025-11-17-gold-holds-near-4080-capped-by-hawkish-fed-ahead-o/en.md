Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a turbulent trading session on Monday, hovering around $4,080 as investors digest the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance ahead of the upcoming Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data. Market sentiment suggests that the Fed is likely to maintain current interest rates during its December meeting, influencing the precious metal's price dynamics.

As traders remain cautious, the focus shifts to crucial economic indicators set to be released later this week. With the USD gaining strength amid expectations of a stable monetary policy, fluctuations in the gold exchange rate could continue, reflecting broader market uncertainties. Investors are keenly watching these developments, as they may impact both gold prices and the broader forex market, including currency pairs like EUR/USD.
