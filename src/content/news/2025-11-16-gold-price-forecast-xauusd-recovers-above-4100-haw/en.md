Gold prices (XAU/USD) experienced a recovery on Friday, climbing back above $4,105 after a two-day decline. The precious metal's upward movement was facilitated by a softer US Dollar (USD), which provided a more favorable trading environment for gold bulls. As the market reacts to shifting currency pair dynamics, traders remain cautious ahead of upcoming remarks from Federal Reserve officials.

Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor Fedspeak on Monday for potential hints regarding monetary policy direction, particularly in light of the Fed's hawkish stance that could limit further gains in gold. With the current exchange rate hovering around $4,105, the interplay between the USD and gold will be critical in shaping market sentiment in the days to come.
