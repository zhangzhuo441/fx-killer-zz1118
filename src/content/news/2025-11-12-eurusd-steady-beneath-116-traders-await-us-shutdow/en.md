The EUR/USD currency pair remains steady beneath the 1.1600 level, as traders closely monitor developments surrounding a potential US government shutdown. With the House of Representatives scheduled to vote on a stopgap funding bill, risk appetite has shown signs of improvement, yet the Euro struggles to break through this key technical threshold.

As the market awaits clarity from the Federal Reserve, the exchange rate reflects a cautious sentiment among investors.
