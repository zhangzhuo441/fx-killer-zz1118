West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has surged to approximately $59.90, marking a rise of over 2% as trading unfolds in the Asian session on Friday. This uptick comes amid growing concerns over supply risks attributed to impending United States sanctions, which are expected to impact oil availability in the market.

The market's reaction underscores the sensitivity of commodity prices to geopolitical developments, with traders closely monitoring the implications of these sanctions. As WTI approaches the key psychological level of $60.00, fluctuations in the USD may further influence the exchange rate dynamics for oil-related currency pairs, potentially shaping the broader market landscape in the coming days.
