The EUR/USD currency pair is currently experiencing a range-trading phase, with prices expected to oscillate between key technical levels of 1.1595 and 1.1645. This movement reflects a period of consolidation in the market, as traders assess economic indicators and geopolitical developments influencing both the Euro and the US Dollar.

Factors such as fluctuating interest rates and differing economic data from the Eurozone and the US are contributing to this stability. As the exchange rate remains confined to this range, traders are likely to adopt a cautious approach, monitoring any potential breakouts that could indicate a shift in momentum.
