The USD is gaining momentum as a potential trade deal between the US and Switzerland appears to be on the horizon. Commerzbank's FX analyst, Michael Pfister, highlights that this development may signal an end to the trade conflict with the few remaining countries yet to establish agreements with the US. This optimism could strengthen the USD against other currencies in the forex market.

As traders monitor the situation, the USD/EUR pair is poised to react to any updates surrounding the trade discussions. A favorable outcome could drive the exchange rate higher, reinforcing the USD's dominance. Market participants are advised to keep a close watch on price movements, as the implications of a successful deal could ripple across various currency pairs, potentially shifting trading strategies in the coming days.
