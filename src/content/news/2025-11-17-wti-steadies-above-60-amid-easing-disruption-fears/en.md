West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has stabilized above $60 a barrel, bolstered by a steady risk sentiment in the market. The recent resumption of shipments from Russia's Novorossiysk hub, which had been disrupted by last week’s Ukrainian strike, has alleviated some supply concerns. This development has contributed to a cautious but optimistic tone among traders.

As WTI trades higher, the implications for the USD/EUR exchange rate could be significant, potentially affecting inflation and monetary policy discussions. Investors are closely monitoring these movements as they navigate the complexities of supply-demand dynamics and geopolitical tensions. The steady recovery in oil prices may lead to fluctuations in related currency pairs, influencing broader market trends.
