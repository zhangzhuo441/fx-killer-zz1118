Dow Jones futures rose by 0.18%, trading above 47,150 during European hours as the US Senate moved forward with plans to end the government shutdown. This positive momentum was mirrored in the broader market, with S&P 500 futures increasing by 0.70% to around 6,800 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbing 1.24% to approximately 25,450.

The advances in US futures could influence currency pairs involving the USD, particularly against the EUR, as traders anticipate a potential rally in stocks. The improved market sentiment may also lead to adjustments in exchange rates, with stronger demand for the dollar if the government shutdown is resolved, affecting forex trading dynamics in the coming sessions.
