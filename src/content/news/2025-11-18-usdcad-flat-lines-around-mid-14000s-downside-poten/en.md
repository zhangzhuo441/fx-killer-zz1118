The USD/CAD currency pair is currently trading in a tight range around the mid-1.4000s, showing little movement after a previous rally that saw it reach a one-and-a-half-week high. During the Asian session on Tuesday, the exchange rate has struggled to build on the gains from the day prior, indicating a period of consolidation.

Market sentiment suggests that the downside potential for USD/CAD appears limited, as traders weigh macroeconomic factors and recent price action. This phase of stability may set the stage for future movements, as investors continue to monitor developments that could impact the Canadian and U.S. economies.
