The USD/JPY currency pair is showing robust performance, trading above the pivotal level of 155.00 and currently hovering around 155.20 in the early Asian session on Tuesday. This strength comes as traders prepare for the upcoming release of US economic data, which could significantly influence market sentiment and trading strategies.

As the exchange rate for USD/JPY remains positive, market participants are closely monitoring the implications of the data on the dollar's performance against the yen. A strong showing from the US data could further bolster the USD, while any signs of weakness may lead to volatility in the forex market, particularly for this key currency pair.
