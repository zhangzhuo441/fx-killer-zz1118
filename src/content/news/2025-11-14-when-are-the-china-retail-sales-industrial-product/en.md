The National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) will release its October data, including Retail Sales and Industrial Production, at 02:00 GMT. Analysts anticipate a year-over-year increase of 2.7% in Retail Sales, down from the previous 3.0%. This slowdown may imply reduced consumer demand, potentially impacting the AUD/USD exchange rate as traders assess the implications for economic growth in both Australia and China.

Market participants will closely monitor these figures, as any significant deviation could influence trading strategies involving the AUD/USD currency pair. A weaker than expected Retail Sales figure might lead to increased selling pressure on the Australian dollar as concerns over a slowing Chinese economy emerge, affecting overall market sentiment and risk appetite. As the data unfolds, volatility in the forex market may increase, leading to potential shifts in the USD’s strength against the AUD.
