EUR/USD began the week on a cautious note, pulling back to the 1.1600 level as traders reacted to Friday's reversal from session highs that exceeded 1.1650. The current exchange rate reflects a market sentiment that remains uncertain, especially with the upcoming release of delayed US macroeconomic data, which is expected to significantly influence trading dynamics.

As the currency pair fluctuates, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators that could signal shifts in the USD's strength or the euro's resilience. With the exchange rate hovering around 1.1600, any volatility in the data could lead to further movements, either pushing EUR/USD back towards resistance levels or solidifying its current downtrend.
