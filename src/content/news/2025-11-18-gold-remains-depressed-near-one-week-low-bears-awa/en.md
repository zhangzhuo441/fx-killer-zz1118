Gold (XAU/USD) continues its downward trajectory for the fourth consecutive day, hitting an over one-week low on Tuesday. The precious metal has seen increased bearish sentiment, yet it manages to cling to the critical $4,000 psychological support level during the Asian trading session. 

Traders are now closely monitoring for a potential break below this key threshold, which could further intensify selling pressure. The ongoing strength of the USD has contributed to gold's struggles, as fluctuations in exchange rates impact demand for the non-yielding asset. As market participants await further developments, the focus remains on how these factors will influence gold's trading dynamics in the coming days.
