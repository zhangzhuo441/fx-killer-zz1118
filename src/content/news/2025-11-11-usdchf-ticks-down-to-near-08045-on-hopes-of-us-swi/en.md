The USD/CHF currency pair has declined slightly to around 0.8045 during the late Asian trading session on Tuesday. This movement can be attributed to the Swiss Franc's (CHF) strength against its counterparts, driven by growing optimism surrounding a potential trade agreement between the United States and Switzerland. 

The prospect of a trade deal has bolstered the CHF, leading to some selling pressure on the USD. As traders monitor developments in US-Swiss relations, fluctuations in the exchange rate could continue, reflecting the underlying sentiment in the market. Investors are keenly watching for further news that may influence trading dynamics between these two currencies.
