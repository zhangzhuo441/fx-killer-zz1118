Dow Jones futures climbed 0.18% to surpass 47,300 during European trading hours on Monday, as investors prepared for the delayed release of key US economic data. The uptick reflects a cautious optimism among traders, particularly as the Federal Reserve continues to signal its intentions regarding monetary policy.

Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures gained 0.57%, trading near 6,800, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.90% to approach 25,300. This upward momentum suggests a potential positive impact on currency pairs, particularly the USD against the EUR, as market participants react to impending economic indicators that could influence exchange rates and trading strategies.
