The Indian Rupee (INR) opened flat against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, with the USD/INR currency pair trading sideways around the 88.85 level. This stability comes as investors closely monitor ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and India, hoping for a breakthrough that could impact market sentiment and the exchange rate.

With little movement observed over the past week, market participants are cautious, weighing economic indicators and geopolitical developments. The focus now shifts to upcoming retail inflation data from India, which could provide further insight into the currency's trajectory and influence trading strategies in the forex market.
