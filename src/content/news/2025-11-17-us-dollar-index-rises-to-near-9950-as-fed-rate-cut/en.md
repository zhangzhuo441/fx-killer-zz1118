The US Dollar Index (DXY) is gaining momentum, trading near 99.50 during the Asian session on Monday. This marks the second consecutive day of increases for the index, which gauges the USD's strength against six major currencies. The rise comes as market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut have waned, boosting investor confidence in the greenback.

As the DXY climbs, currency pairs such as EUR/USD are experiencing shifts in exchange rates, reflecting the dollar's strengthened position. The implications of this movement could impact global trade dynamics, with a firmer USD potentially influencing commodity prices and cross-currency flows. Traders will be closely monitoring upcoming economic data and Federal Reserve signals that could further affect the dollar's trajectory.
